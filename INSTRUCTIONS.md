# acm-akron-webathon-resources
This is a repo you may branch from to build for our mini-hackathon. (4/15/23)

## Project Goals
Create a website (or components thereof) to go along with your own ideas for our potential users.
These users would be ACM members, UA students, or anyone affiliated in between. Certain ideas
could be, for example:

- An events page and/or calendar
- Social media components
- "About Us" Page
- Back-end / Maintenance detail
- "Contact Us" components

## Tools to Use

Please use a public repository on Github for ideas implemented with code. Branching from this repo
would be ideal. Do as much as you can with your ability and passion. Share ideas in any other ways
at presentation if you are not a programmer.

Example ACM Chapter Websites:
- www.uscacm.org
- www.uclaacm.com

Be creative in whichever area you are most passionate and talented in, we do not expect a full-and-working
website in this timeframe.

If you are new to front-end development, I would start to investigate how you may use frameworks like
React, Angular, or any of your choosing to bring about modern website design in combination with your
HTML/CSS basics.

Use GitHub desktop to easily work with repositories like this one on Windows. If on a different platform, you will need to learn the terminal commands for Git itself and configure your setup.

## Prizes

3rd Place - Case of Monster Energy

## Event Times / Location

We will be holding a helpful build event this saturday (4/15) in order to go over these details and get the competition rolling. It is not necessary to attend, but please especially show to (4/19) our presentation day to give a quick talk about your ideas! It will definitely help in the race if your implementation is slow.
